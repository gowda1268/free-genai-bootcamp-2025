Here are examples of user input and assitant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

    | Japanese | Romaji | English
    |          | kuma	| bear |
    |          | tobira | door |
    |          | gomi	| garbage |
    |          | noko	| leave behind |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
    For the first clause, we can use the verb (aru) which means "to exist" or "to be present". We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
    For the second clause, we can use the verb (nokosu) which is a more polite way of saying "to leave behind". Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.

    Here's a possible sentence structure:

    [Clause 1: Bears are at the door]
    [Subject] wa [Location] ni [Verb] desu
    [Clause 2: did you leave the garbage out?]
    [Verb] masu ka

    Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>10/score>
    <score_reasons>
    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation

Cheatsheet:

Word          |	Japanese                        | Type
see	          |見る (miru)                      |  Transitive Ichidan Verb
raven         |	鴉 (karasu)	                    | Noun
this morning  | 今朝 (kōchō)                    |	Noun
they	      |彼ら (karera)                    | 	Pronoun
were looking  |	見ていた (miteita)               |	Verb (past progressive)
our garden	  |私たちの庭 (watashitachi no niwa) |	Noun

 
 Sentence structure:
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

However, this sentence structure is not suitable for the given sentence. A more accurate sentence structure would be:
[Question] [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Time]? [Subject] [Verb-past] [Location]
Or, in a more conceptual sense:
[Did you] [see] [what] [when]? [They] [did what] [where]?

Possible Japanese Translation:
"あなたは今朝、カラスを見た？彼らは私たちの庭を見ていた。"

Mistakes and Areas for Improvement:

- The student's input is in English, and we need to work on translating it into Japanese.
- The sentence structure is a bit complex, and we need to break it down into smaller parts to understand the grammar and vocabulary.

Possible next steps:
- attempt to translate the sentence into Japanese
- ask clues about question formation
- ask clues about verb conjugation (e.g., how to form the past tense of 見る)
- ask clues about sentence structure (e.g., how to connect two sentences with a comma)
